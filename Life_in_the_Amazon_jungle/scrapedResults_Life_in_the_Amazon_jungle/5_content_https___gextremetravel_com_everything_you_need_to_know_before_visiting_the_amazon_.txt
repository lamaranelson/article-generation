If you’re thinking about living in the Amazon rainforest, you’re in for a real treat! There are endless things to do and see in this lush and vibrant landscape. 
But before you take the plunge, it’s important to know what you’re getting yourself into. So Goofball! Strap yourself in reading on for everything you need to know about living in the Amazon rainforest before you travel there! 
I am pretty sure there are plenty of places around the world that will let you be speechless in their presence. But the Amazon Rainforest is a whole different beast!
Indeed the Amazon Rainforest is the largest rainforest on earth. Spanning a distance of around 5 million square kilometers, this alone puts it on many people’s bucket lists.
But, how does the Amazon Basin cover around 40 percent of South America🌎? The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest. Followed by Peru at 13%, and Colombia at 10%. And with minor amounts in other countries such as Bolivia, Venezuela, and Ecuador.
There are plenty of other reasons why you should experience this place to the fullest. If you are considering visiting, traveling, or living it anytime soon, you should read the following In-Depth travel guide for the Amazon Rainforest.
Not only does the Amazon represent half of the Earth’s remaining rainforest, but it is also known for its unmatched biodiversity. The rainforest is home to at least 40,000 plant species. As well as several thousand species of birds and fishes, hundreds of species of mammals and reptiles, and almost 2,5 million species of insects.
All of this can make it quite overwhelming and scary to even think about living in the Amazon. But as always, that’s why Giorgy aka G-Extreme is here! I lived in the Amazon Rainforest for a short period of time and I wish I could have stayed longer.
It is a captivating place and visiting it might change your perspective on the world. But, it’s important that we go back to the story and understand the culture first. 
Let’s dive in together on the history first if you want to live here in order to understand the basics and have an unforgettable experience!
If we take a step back in time, we can see that the Amazon has been inhabited by indigenous groups for at least 11,200 years. Before Europeans (oh no… humans arrived) arrived in the 16th century and started persecuting the locals. There were approximately 6.8 million native people living in South America. 
As the European explorers had unknowingly brought with them viruses such as smallpox, measles, and the common cold. This led to, unfortunately, disastrous consequences because the indigenous groups had no immunity to these foreign illnesses💊.
The remaining tribes are those that isolated themselves deep within the rainforest. Or were forcibly pushed there by Europeans through persecution, slavery, and warfare.
Not only do indigenous groups have to worry about diseases, but they also suffer from the many legal and illegal activities that exploit forests. Yeah, you are thinking right: such as drug trafficking, logging, rubber tapping, mining, and ranching. 
To make matters worse, these groups were greatly affected by recent fires that destroyed their land and livelihoods.
Although the number is low, there are still some ‘uncontacted tribes’ that remain living in isolation which is mostly found in Brazil and Peru. In an effort to preserve these cultures, South American governments have created policies prohibiting contact with these tribes.
The worry that these uncontacted tribes will be exposed to diseases like measles or the flu is always present. Therefore Peru and Brazil have established reserves where tribes are shielded from exploitation and modern illnesses.
With there being little known about uncontacted tribes, it’s difficult to say how many there are in the world. It is possible that Brazil alone has around 70 such groups living in seclusion within the Amazon. 
However, as deforestation and land exploitation increase, some of these groups have been forced to take steps towards initiating ‘first contact’. This has caused quite a bit of turmoil for protection agencies who now have to consider things like epidemics, language barriers, territory boundaries, and cultural differences when formulating new policies.
It would behoove the seven billion people not living in the Amazon Rainforest to take lessons from indigenous tribes about how best to respect and live off the land. According to studies, 12 percent of the Amazon’s dry land has been edited by humans for continual habitation. 
These people know how to survive without depleting resources and destroying their surroundings. The lung of our planet is one of the most biodiverse lands on Earth because these groups have protected it for centuries! Benefiting all humanity in doing so.
You can take part in a tribute not only by learning how they live inside such an amazing beautiful forest. You’ll also get the chance to learn more about their natural medicine and survive in there, as well respecting nature’s creatures!
The Amazon rainforest is one of the most biodiverse places on earth, and living there would be an incredible experience. There are many different tribes that live in the Amazon rainforest, each with its own unique culture and way of life.
Not only humans live in there. But it is estimated that there are more than 1,000 different species of animals living in the Amazon rainforest.
By taking an Amazon vacation, not only you immerse yourself in the rainforest and get to know its interesting wildlife. But you can also interact with local tribes who have a wealth of knowledge about their traditional way of life.
And knowing beforehand what it’s like living in the Amazon rainforest would assure to have a unique and amazing experience once there.
As I already mentioned, Amazon extends across more than six countries, which can make it an all-year-round destination.
However, it’s good to understand the weather conditions in the rainforest so you could plan your visit accordingly. Despite its massive size, weather patterns in the Amazon don’t change much from season to season. And they’re characterized by rain, humidity, and heat🌦️.
The rainforest has two distinct seasons: low water season and high water season. The low water season is from July to December and it’s known for lower rivers, better trail access, and less precipitation. The low water season is also the peak season so make sure to make your bookings in advance!
On the other hand, if you feel adventurous the high water season is awaiting you! From May to early June you could encounter higher rivers, slightly cooler temperatures, and intermittent daily showers🌧️ which can be occasionally pretty heavy as well as better river access. Fewer people around which means lower prices too and you don’t have to stress out about accommodation options!
No matter when you decide to go, it’s always good to be flexible because heavy rains could always affect your itinerary! 
The Amazon Rainforest is home to 6 countries although the most prominent in Brazil, there are different ways to get to the Amazon Rainforest.

Things To Do In The Amazon Rainforest🌱Here I have listed some of my top recommendations for you while you are visiting. Make sure to read them if you are interested in doing something spectacular hihi and making your friends jealous.
The Amazon is not your typical travel destination, so you must pack carefully and mindfully. Some stuff is good to leave home, while others are mandatory for anyone.
Depending on which part of Amazon you visit, unfortunately, English is not widely spoken in any part of it. So I recommend you learn some basic Portuguese or Spanish phrases🗣️ in order to be able to get around! Of course, you can always use the help of a digital translator ready to support you in this adventure.
Keep in mind that ATMs nor credit cards are very UNCOMMON in any part of Amazon. Be sure to get enough cash before heading to the Rainforest.
And do not bother bringing plugs, you won’t encounter an adapter in the middle of the jungle! Think of taking a power bank in case your electronic stuff runs out of battery. Or staying disconnected from the rest of the world would be a better option as well!
